## üìÇ Important Folders

Pimify relies on three main folders for data storage and management. Make sure these folders are properly configured in your environment:

1. **`data/`**: 
   - Stores the actual database file.

2. **`backups/`**: 
   - Contains database backups (last 3 months by default).
   - You can update this setting in the `scheduler.py` file if you want to adjust the backup retention period.

3. **`media/`**: 
   - Stores image and video files.

Ensure these folders are persisted properly when running Pimify in a containerized or production environment.
